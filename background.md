**Observation Space**

Meaning: The observation space defines what information the RL agent receives about its current environment (the simulation state) at each step. It's the agent's "senses" or "perception" of the world. The agent uses this information to decide what action to take next.

In **MissileRLAgent.py**: the MissileRLAgent's get_observation() method explicitly defines its observation space.
